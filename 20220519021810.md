# Fixing my zettels

Creating a Zet is proving to be much more complex than I initially thought it would. I thought it would be as simple as implementing a couple VIM plugins, but those plugins didn't quite accomplish what I wanted them to do.

I eventually managed to find Rob's [zet-cmd](https://github.com/rwxrob/zet-cmd) repo and forked it. From there, I started to reverse engineer it to produce individual zettels instead of creating directories with READMEs. I think Rob's rationale in creating separate directories for each Zet was to display the README whenever someone navigates to the directory and be able to add extra files in the dedicated directory if it related to the thought. However, I personally don't like the idea of having 10,000 directories on my hard drive or in my repo.

I believe I've tackled 90% of the zet-cmd, minus the cast commands (which are used to produce YouTube recordings Zets). If you'd like to visit my fork, you can find it at [this repo](https://github.com/controlshifted/zet-cmd). I think there are still a couple commands which don't work as I haven't managed to decipher the bashscript (I'm still learning), but I would like to eventually improve my reverse hackery, make it cleaner, more efficient and perhaps even implement my own stuff in there. Needless to say, thank you so much to Rob for creating the command and saving so much time for me.
