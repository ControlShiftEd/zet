# Creating a Zettelkasten

As you may know, I have a [Notes](https://github.com/controlshifted/notes) repository where I write documentation and personal notes about installation and setup for applications and software. I thought it would be a good idea to extend this to some daily/weekly/monthly writing (We'll see how this goes). As someone who is always fairly organized, I was looking at some ways to write a blog / note-taking. At first, I found this nifty program called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). It's feature-rich, looks and feels like Visual Studio Code. However, I've really wanted to focus on the command-line and VIM for the past year to try to become more fluent with the CLI. Therefore, I obviously went the long route and spent about 10 hours to do something which has a nice GUI and can be done in 3 minutes. Was it worth it though? 100%.

## The process

It all started with a streamer I know called rwxrob ([Link to Twitch](https://twitch.tv/rwxrob)) and noticing his VIM was doing some funky things when writing in Markdown. I wanted that. He shared his dotfiles with me, and I stumbled on [Vimawesome](https://vimawesome.com). For the past little while, I used a VIM plugin called Pathogen (by Tim Pope), but didn't really like the way that Pathogen worked. Sure, all you had to do was add a single line to load all your plugins, but for some reason it was rather hit or miss. It was clear I had to explore some alternatives, and that's when I found [Vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) by Junegunn. Honestly, this filled all my requirements as it allowed to load individual plugins in my .bashrc file and install them all separately if I desired. No need to really install them either.

As I was exploring Rob's dotfiles, I found a plugin he was using named [vim-pandoc](https://github.com/vim-pandoc/vim-pandoc) and its counterpart vim-pandoc-syntax. Hit the jackpot. It makes Markdown much easier to read and navigate. Quickly install them, and then I moved on to creating my Zettelkasten.

I found this awesome website all about Zettelkasten in VIM ([Link Here](https://www.edwinwenink.xyz/posts/48-vim_fast_creating_and_linking_notes/#2edc7bf0-859e-11ea-a16d-e7b30751e183)). In it, it shares some quick scripting on how to create a Zettel in VIM. After reading the comments, it seemed some people were able to make it slightly more efficient (or simpler? Or maybe I'm just making things up) with a VIM plugin called [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) (You'll also want to install [fzf.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/fzfvim), coincidentally also created by Junegunn. If I was going to jump down the rabbit hole, may as well go the whole way. fzf seems to be a CLI search function which allows you to find files simply by searching some text. I think it also allows you to search for tags, which is the whole point of zettelkasten, but we'll figure that out later. The code from Edwin worked phenomenally, but for some reason the fzf was creating an extra I character. After some extra searching through the issues on Github, it turns out it may be a distro issue or a specific version of VIM problem. Adding the {down: 100%} option to the fzf#run function seemed to fix it though. Added some aliases and commands, and we were set! I could now create some zettels through VIM.

But what if I want to create zettels from the CLI? Listen, I'm NOT the best at BASH scripting, but the basics is all you need. Since much of the hard work is already programmed in my .vimrc, all I needed to do was access it from there. So, I create a new script called zet (make sure you chmox it), then add an argument to zet to create the title for the new zettel. If you add "", then you can make it multiple words too. And that's it! Now I can create Zettels directly from VIM, or from the CLI. Last but not least, I created a new repo on my github and added some additional commands to instantly push the new zettel once it's saved. Simplicity at its best. If you'd like to see how I accomplished all this, feel free to check out my [dotfiles](https://github.com/controlshifted/dotfiles) repo (primarily the .bashrc, the .vimrc, and the zet script).

I sincerely hope this encourages me to write some more. Let the note-taking begin!
